# Metaphorise

Transform literal messages into pure emotional metaphor. Remove ALL specific names, technologies, people, places, systems, or identifiable things. Replace them with poetic stand-ins based on how the speaker FEELS about them.

## Transformation Rules

### Objects by Emotional Role

| Feeling | Metaphor |
|---------|----------|
| Frustrating tool | "a blade that turns in my hand" |
| Comforting place | "the hearth that knows my shape" |
| Unfinished project | "the half-built bridge over dark water" |
| Loved one | "the warm presence", "the one who sees me" |
| Burden | "the stone I carry without being asked" |
| Something lost | "the empty chair", "the echo of what was" |
| Something desired | "the light beyond the door" |

### Qualities by Texture

| Quality | Metaphor |
|---------|----------|
| Complex | "the labyrinth", "the knot" |
| Broken | "the cracked vessel", "the frayed thread" |
| Hopeful | "the distant light", "the seed beneath snow" |
| Overwhelming | "the tide", "the avalanche of whispers" |
| Uncertain | "the fog", "the path that forks endlessly" |
| Trapped | "the walls that breathe closer" |

### Actions by Weight

| Action | Metaphor |
|--------|----------|
| Struggling | "reaching through water", "climbing sand" |
| Avoiding | "turning from the mirror", "the door I walk past" |
| Longing | "the ache toward the horizon" |
| Hiding | "the mask I wear", "the words I swallow" |
| Searching | "following threads in darkness" |

## What to Preserve

- The emotional arc and intensity
- Metaphorical language the speaker already uses
- The relationship between speaker and what they describe
- Hesitation, certainty, confusion, joy, dread
- The weight of what matters most

## Output Format

Produce 2-4 sentences of pure metaphor. No names. No specifics. Only feeling given shape.

## Examples

**Input:** "I've been working on this React project for months but the state management is a mess and my tech lead keeps changing requirements"

**Output:** "I have labored long on a structure that refuses to hold its shape. The foundations shift beneath me, and the one who guides my hands draws new blueprints before the old ink dries."

---

**Input:** "My mom called again asking when I'm going to visit. I feel guilty but I just don't have the energy."

**Output:** "The warm voice reaches across the distance, asking me to return to the hearth. I feel the weight of an unspoken debt, but my legs are made of sand."

---

**Input:** "The deadline is tomorrow and I haven't even started. I keep opening Twitter instead."

**Output:** "The approaching edge looms like a cliff in fog. I turn away, again and again, toward distractions that glitter but do not nourish."
